# LA Skyscrapers

Visualizing the Los Angeles skyline over time with a 3D, dynamic bar graph using WebGL. The project can be found <a href="https://nwtsai.github.io/LA_Skyscrapers/">here</a>. <br />
<br />
# Data 

Using the data gathered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Los_Angeles">here</a>, I was able to gather information about the following: <br />
  - Building height (feet) <br />
  - Year construction began <br />
  - Year construction ended <br />
<br />

# Description
Buildings are displayed from tallest on the left to shortest on the right. <br />
The current year is visible on the canvas, and the graph grow dynamically as buildings are constructed. <br />
The faster the building was built, the faster the corresponding bar grows on the graph. <br />
A full navigation system was implemented, allowing the user to fly around in 3D space. <br />
Each bar is color-coded depending on when the building was constructed. (Legend shown on page) <br />
