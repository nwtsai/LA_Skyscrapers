# midterm-hackathon49

We are creating a visual data representation of the tallest 35 buildings in the <br />
Los Angeles area.<br />
<br />
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Los_Angeles><br />
From this website, we got the data for the following<br />
  - Building height in feet<br />
  - Year construction began<br />
  - Year construction ended<br />
<br />
Buildings are shown from tallest on the left to shortest on the right. We have<br />
a display showing the current year in the visualization. Buildings will grow<br />
when it reaches the year it was constructed and will build until its relative<br />
height. Building stops in the number of years corresponding to the actual number<br />
of years construction took.
